# Tiles
A Relaxing Website for Creating Colorful Mosaics

This is a work-in-progress webpage I am creating in an attempt to framiliarize myself with using html, javascript, and css.
It's a pretty simple website but one that I'm proud of. Select colors from the top row to choose what color you are painting with
and simply click on tiles to change them to a random hue of that color. 

The concept for the website comes from bubble wrap, something simple and relaxing in todays crazy world.
